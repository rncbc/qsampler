  thanks).

- Translations install directory change.

- Added support for SF2 instrument names/preset enumeration.

- Added instrument list popup on channel strip which shows up when 
  the instrument name is clicked. Allows faster switching among 
  instruments of the same file.

- Adjusted configure check for libgig to detect its new --libdir

0.2.3  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.

- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

- Standard scalable format (SVG) and MIME type icons support for 
  session files (*.lscp) is now being added.

- Preparations for Qt5 migration.

- Added include <unistd.h> to shut up gcc 4.7 build failures.

- Make(ing) -jN parallel builds now available for the masses.

- Fixed Makefile.in handling of installation directories to the 
  configure script eg. --datadir, --localedir.

- Made lookup of translation files work inside a Mac OS X bundle.

- Minor Mac OS X compilation error fix.

- Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.

- Made lookup of translation files more robust on Windows.

- Fixes for cross compiling and building for Windows with configure 
  and make.

- libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link phase, as 
  seen necessary on some bleeding-edge distros eg. Fedora 13, Debian 
  6.

- Moving from old deprecated Qt3'ish custom event post handling into 
  regular asynchronous signal/slot strategy.

- Sampler channel and instrument file requester support for other 
  than GIG engine instrument files (*gig; *.dls) has been added, 
  making roads for the newer SFZ and SF2 engines instrument files 
  (*.sfz; *.sf2).

- General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.

- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has been 
  slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to wrong main 
  widget hidden state.

- General source tree layout and build configuration change.

- Automatic crash-dump reports, debugger stack-traces (gdb), back- 
  traces, whatever, are being introduced as a brand new configure 
  option (--enable-stacktrace) and default enabled on debug build 
  targets (--enable-debug).

- Attempt to fix broken instrument list model/view on Qt >= 4.6.

- Device parameter spin-box default maximum has been set higher: now 
  at a magic 24-bit limit (16777216) instead of older 16-bit (65536), 
  possibly fixing bug #136.

- LADISH Level 1 support has been added: SIGUSR1 signal trap just 
  makes it a shortcut to File/Save.

- MIDI Device Status menu is disabled when no MIDI device exists;
  a menu separator has been added.

- Window manager's close button was found missing from the Devices 
  and Instruments widgets when on Qt >= 4.5, now fixed.

- MIDI activity indicator on channel strips and MIDI device status 
  widgets is now implemented as a flashing green LED, instead of a 
  lame green solid background :).

- Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to 
  disk when View/Options... dialog changes are accepted and applied.

- Czech (cs) translation added (by Pavel Fric).


0.2.2  2009-08-01  New release cycle.

- Russian (qsampler_ru.ts by Alexandre Prokoudine) makes it as
  brand first translation delivered. Thanks and welcomes whom ever
  may follow ;)

- Converted obsolete QMessageBox forms to standard buttons.

- Added support for runtime max. voices / disk streams setting 
  (accessible from the "Options..." dialog). Those fine tuning 
  settings will be saved in case the user modified them and 
  automatically restored to the sampler when reconnecting to
  a sampler the next time. 

- Grayed/disabled palette color group fix for dark color themes.

- Fait-divers: desktop menu file touched to openSUSE conventions.

- Due to some trouble with newer Qt >= 4.4 applications regarding 
  font size configuration, a new global user option is now available 
  to the rescue: View/Options... /Display/Other/Base font size 
  (default none).

- Attempt to load Qt's own translation support and get rid of the 
  ever warning startup message, unless built in debug mode. 
  (transaction by Guido Scholz, while on qsynth-devel, thanks).

- Only one application instance is now allowed to be up and running, 
  with immediate but graceful termination upon startup iif an already 
  running instance is detected, which will see its main widget shown 
  up automatically (Qt/X11 platform only).

- Messages file logging makes its first long overdue appearance, 
  with user configurable settings in View/Options.../Server/Logging.

- Bugfix in sampler channel dialog, driver combo boxes' content were 
  screwed.

- Automatically add & remove channel strips as they were removed 
  e.g. by other frontends.

- Refresh device management dialog when device informations changed, 
  e.g. on changes caused by other frontends (fixes segfault on device 
  changes)

- Implemented MIDI device activity windows, selectable from the 
  "View" main menu.

- Implemented MIDI activity indicator on channel strips.

- Added FX Sends Dialog to Channel Strips.

- Color pallete fix for the instrument name display in channel 
  strip, particularly notorious on Mac OS X builds.

- Added dialog when the application exits which lets the user decide 
  whether to keep the LinuxSampler running or not.


0.2.1  2007-12-06  Qt4 migration was complete.

- Added recent new support of libgig for retrieving instrument names 
  in avery fast way. If libgig provides this feature, then the 
  respective name retrieval setting in qsampler is enabled by default.

- The current selected/activated channel-strip is now visually 
  evident while in the application workspace (highlighting).

- Make View/Menubar and Toolbar shortcuts accessible even though the 
  main menu and toobar are not visible.

- Audio routing table is initially hidden in the dialog, when 
  creating a new sampler channel.

- README requirements and configuration notes update.

- Disable OK button in sampler channel form and MIDI instrument
  form if no valid engine is selected (to avoid bothering newbie
  users with confusing LSCP syntax errors when using the UI the
  first time).

- Fixed creation of devices (don't try to set device parameters 
  which the user did not touch in the device creation dialog).

- Added Windows file path support.

- Fixed win32/qmakefile and win32/config.h so that it compiles
  under win32.

- Qt4 port of the application.


0.1.5  2007-10-15 Five months later a fifth is heard.

- Added support for LSCP escape sequences to allow loading and 
  mapping instrument files with special characters in their filename, 
  as well as special characters for instrument names and instrument 
  map names (requires LSCP v1.2 on sampler side).

- Added new button "Edit" to the channel strips, which probably does 
  exactly what you think it does: it opens an appropriate instrument 
  editor application; the channel instrument editor tool is also 
  accessible from the main menu and toolbar.

- Application icon is now installed to ${prefix}/share/pixmaps; 
  application desktop entry file is now included in installation;
  spec file (RPM) is now a bit more openSUSE compliant.

- Crash fix on double-clicking on a empty instrument list.


0.1.4  2007-05-04 Almost another year has gone by.

- Channel button colors have changed: yellow for mute and cyan
  for solo is now the rule, but note that this color highlighting
  is only rendered on some widget styles.

- Master sampler volume slider/spinbox combo is now featured.

- Initial support for sampler channel FX sends, while saving the 
  session state, only at code-level.

- Sampler channel setup dialog does not mandate for valid nor 
  existing instrument file name.

- Revised error verbosity in general and on session load/save; 
  hour-glass wait cursor is now displayed on session load/save; 
  keyboard shortcuts changed on MIDI instruments view context; 
  improved channel strip arrangement on session open/load;
  instrument map entry removal confirmation (as optional);
  corrected some tooltip text strings.

- Most top-level widgets were missing the normal-widget flag, which 
  were causing some sticky size behavior while on some window 
  managers.

- Added preliminary MIDI instrument mapping support; now with an 
  instrument list widget and editing capabilities; MIDI instrumeent 
  map program numbers are now displayed in the range 1-128, instead
  of the internal 0-127.

- GPL address update.


0.1.3   2006-06-01 Its been a long year isn't it?

- Changed deprecated copyright attribute to license, on 
  qsampler.spec (RPM).

- Added configure support for x86_64 libraries (UNTESTED).

- Optional specification of alternate liblscp and libgig 
  installation paths have been added to configure command arguments 
  (--with-liblscp, --with-libgig).

- Whenever the listing of actual instrument names is not an option 
  (e.g. due to lack of libgig support), the whole number of selectable 
  instrument items is now being graciously increased from just the 
  bare 8 (eight) right up through 100 (one hundred), on the sampler 
  channel setup dialog.

- The selection buttons, on the right of the Instrument, Audio and 
  MIDI devices combo-boxes, on the sampler channel dialog, are now 
  expected to be a little better looking than it was before, at least 
  for those Mac OS X eyes.

- Minor fixing on the initial messages dock-window height.

- Audio output channel routing configuration finally hits the 
  sampler channel dialog, at last!

- All widget captions changed to include proper application title 
  name prefix.

- Attempt to bring those aging autoconf templates to date; sample 
  SPEC file for RPM build is now being included and generated at 
  configure time.

- Set to use QApplication::setMainWidget() instead of registering 
  the traditional lastWindowClosed() signal to quit() slot, just to 
  let the -geometry command line argument have some effect on X11.

- Added MUTE/SOLO buttons to individual channel strips.

- Fixed compilation error which occured when Qt was compiled with 
  -no-stl.


0.1.2   2005-06-23 Even minor workings needs a rest.

- Fixed output disability when messages limit option is turned off 
  (thanks to Wolfgang Woehl for spotting this one, while on qjackctl).

- Added CHANNEL_INFO event feedback notification handling; minor 
  stream/voice usage auto-refresh cycle optimization.


0.1.1   2005-06-12 The mantra of bugfixes.

- New improved and full-featured application icon, thanks to 
  Christian Schoenebeck design.

- Fixed refresh cycle of channel strips that are found in an error 
  state, which was preventing correct channel info updates.

- Device configuration now accessible on toolbar. Added buddy text 
  label to device port/channel combobox on the device dialog.

- Include libgig version info on command line request (-v).

- Minor configure and Makefile install fixes, as Debian and Mac OS X 
  specialties. Also, install does the right thing with target file 
  modes (thanks to Matt Flax and Ebrahim Mayat, for pointing these 
  out).


0.1.0   2005-05-23  Device configuration breakthrough.

- Device configuration is now complete.

- [bug #9] Fixed for a LSCP command syntax convention consistency, 
  regarding the enumeration of available sampler engines, Audio and 
  MIDI drivers.

- [bug #13] Update instrument names list when a new instrument file 
  is select on the channel setup dialog.

- Show appropriate message in channel strip while loading an 
  instrument.

- Show libgig version in About box (in case libgig is used).


0.0.5   2005-03-04  Fifth alpha-release.

- Fixed device driver type channel information gathering, which was 
  severely flawed, dropping all channel session configurations to the 
  default audio driver type (which is ALSA) unexpectedly.

- Channels are now properly renumbered when saving to a session LSCP 
  script, assuming that it should be always loaded from scratch (i.e. 
  zero channels).

- Disabled MIDI port setting on channel dialog, and on session file 
  save, as its use is still troublesome.

- Added new menu and toolbar option: Reset All Channels.

- Channel setup changes are now properly filtered, as for only those 
  settings that are actually changed gets applied; change information 
  are now also posted to messages window.

- Drag-and-drop of either session files (LSCP scripts) or instrument 
  files (GIG) are now supported. Multiple files drop is allowed, but 
  it only makes sense for instrument files, each one prompting to 
  create a new sampler channel.

- Drag-and-drop to an existing channel strip is now also featured, 
  allowing the in-place change of the channel sampler instrument file.

- Actual instrument names are now optionally retrieved from the 
  instrument file, even though libgig is available, avoiding 
  excessively annoying load times while on the channel dialog, when 
  huge instrument files are selected.

- Set to ignore the SIGPIPE ("Broken pipe") signal, where available, 
  as the default handler is usually fatal when a JACK client is 
  zombified abruptly.

- Messages window limit is now enforced only when the line count 
  exceeds in one third the user configured line count maximum; if Qt 
  3.2.0+ is in use, the QTextView widget is otherwise set to the 
  optimized Qt::LogText format.


0.0.4   2004-11-19  Fourth alpha-release.

- Instrument index selection now made via combo box widget; actual 
  instrument names are now properly retrieved from the instrument 
  file, provided if libgig is available.

- Sampler channels strips are just created if, and only if, the 
  respective channel setup dialog is actually accepted, following 
  common user-interface guidelines.

- Almost complete rewrite of sampler channel strips internal control 
  structures.

- Sampler reset command action added to menu and toolbar.

- MIDI channel selection is now a dropdown list, allowing the 
  explicit selection for "All" channels input per sampler channel 
  (omni mode).

- Channel strip display glass effect has changed background color to 
  black (was green), being now an user option.

- Minor configure fixes.


0.0.3   2004-07-06  Third alpha-release.

- Mon-modal intrument file loading and status support.

- Effective MIDI input port setting on channel dialog, and on 
  session file save.

- Channel dialog gets sensible engine and driver defaults on create 
  time.

- Implied channel reset on successful instrument load.


0.0.2   2004-06-15  Pre-revolutionary release.

- The channel context menu is also accessible by right-clicking over 
  the empty workspace area.

- Added small wait event loop on qsamplerMainForm::stopServer(), so 
  let local server terminate gracefully and stabilize, and avoiding a 
  probable segfault on exit, which was preventing the correct salvage 
  of settings and configuration.

- Maximum channel volume percent setting is now a global option, 
  provided to override the default (which is 100%).

- Client/server transaction timeout option upper limit has been 
  increased from 5000 to 60000 milliseconds.

- A channel context menu is now featured, by right-clicking over 
  each sampler channel strip.

- Commented SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_PORT command from 
  qsamplerMainForm::saveSessionFile(), it has no effect.

- Insert a n #include <unistd.h> on qsamplerMessages.cpp, between a 
  #if !defined(WIN32) clause.

- An initial non zero value (0.8) is now set for volume of every new 
  sampler channel strip.

- The order to load/save and setup channel settings is now as 
  suggested in the following lines:

    SET CHANNEL AUDIO_OUTPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_CHANNEL ... 
    LOAD ENGINE ... 
    LOAD INSTRUMENT ... SET CHANNEL VOLUME ...


0.0.1   2004-06-05  Primordial alpha release.
