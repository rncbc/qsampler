Qsampler - A LinuxSampler Qt GUI Interface
------------------------------------------

ChangeLog


GIT HEAD

- Added French man page (by Olivier Humbert, thanks).

- Make builds reproducible byte for byte, by getting rid of
  the configure build date and time stamps.


0.4.2  2016-11-14  A Fall'16 release.

* Fixed a potential crash on the singleton/unique application
  instance setup.

* Almost complete overhaul on the configure script command
  line options, wrt. installation directories specification,
  eg. --prefix, --bindir, --libdir, --datadir and --mandir.


0.4.1  2016-09-14  End of Summer'16 release.

* Fixed a race condition on creating sampler channels that ended
  in duplicate channel strips; also fixed channel auto-arrange.
  
* Dropped the --enable-qt5 from configure as found redundant
  given that's the build default anyway (suggestion by Guido
  Scholz, while for Qtractor, thanks).

* Automake: set environment variable GCC_COLORS=auto to allow GCC to
  auto detect whether it (sh/c)ould output its messages in color.


0.4.0  2016-04-05  Spring'16 release frenzy.

* Added application keywords to freedesktop.org's AppData.

* Prevent x11extras module from use on non-X11/Unix plaforms.

* Messages standard output capture has been improved again, now
  in both ways a non-blocking pipe may get.

* Single/unique application instance control adapted to Qt5/X11.


0.3.1  2015-07-19  Summer'15 release frenzy.

* Fixed configure script's Qt include directory lookup for some
  64bit Linux flavours.

* Prefer Qt5 over Qt4 by default with configure script.

* A new top-level widget window geometry state save and restore
  sub-routine is now in effect.

* Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.


0.3.0  2015-03-25  Pre-LAC2015 release frenzy.

* Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.

* Added this "Don't ask/show this again" option to some if not most
  of the nagging warning/error message boxes.

* Mac OS X: Fixed default path of linuxsampler binary.

* When closing qsampler and showing the user the dialog whether to
  stop the LinuxSampler backend, set the default selection to "Yes".

* Master volume slider now getting proper layout when changing its
  main toolbar orientation.

* Messages standard output capture has been slightly improved
  as for non-blocking i/o, whenever available.

* Adjusted configure check for libgig to detect the new --includedir.

* A man page has beed added (making up Matt Flax's work on
  debian, thanks).

* Translations install directory change.

* Added support for SF2 instrument names/preset enumeration.

* Added instrument list popup on channel strip which shows up when
  the instrument name is clicked. Allows faster switching among
  instruments of the same file.

* Adjusted configure check for libgig to detect its new --libdir
  (impolitely forcing the user now to have at least libgig 3.3.0).


0.2.3  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

* Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.

* More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

* Standard scalable format (SVG) and MIME type icons support for
  session files (*.lscp) is now being added.

* Preparations for Qt5 migration.

* Added include <unistd.h> to shut up gcc 4.7 build failures.

* Make(ing) -jN parallel builds now available for the masses.

* Fixed Makefile.in handling of installation directories to the
  configure script eg. --datadir, --localedir.

* Made lookup of translation files work inside a Mac OS X bundle.

* Minor Mac OS X compilation error fix.

* Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.

* Made lookup of translation files more robust on Windows.

* Fixes for cross compiling and building for Windows with configure
  and make.

* libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link phase,
  as seen necessary on some bleeding-edge distros eg. Fedora 13,
  Debian 6.

* Moving from old deprecated Qt3'ish custom event post handling
  into regular asynchronous signal/slot strategy.

* Sampler channel and instrument file requester support for
  other than GIG engine instrument files (*gig; *.dls) has
  been added, making roads for the newer SFZ and SF2 engines
  instrument files (*.sfz; *.sf2).

* General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.

* Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has
  been slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to
  wrong main widget hidden state.

* General source tree layout and build configuration change.

* Automatic crash-dump reports, debugger stack-traces (gdb), back-
  traces, whatever, are being introduced as a brand new configure
  option (--enable-stacktrace) and default enabled on debug build
  targets (--enable-debug).

* Attempt to fix broken instrument list model/view on Qt >= 4.6.

* Device parameter spin-box default maximum has been set higher:
  now at a magic 24-bit limit (16777216) instead of older 16-bit
  (65536), possibly fixing bug #136.

* LADISH Level 1 support has been added: SIGUSR1 signal trap
  just makes it a shortcut to File/Save.

* MIDI Device Status menu is disabled when no MIDI device exists;
  a menu separator has been added.

* Window manager's close button was found missing from the Devices
  and Instruments widgets when on Qt >= 4.5, now fixed.

* MIDI activity indicator on channel strips and MIDI device status
  widgets is now implemented as a flashing green LED, instead of a
  lame green solid background :).

* Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to
  disk when View/Options... dialog changes are accepted and applied.

* Czech (cs) translation added (by Pavel Fric).


0.2.2  2009-08-01  New release cycle.

* Russian (qsampler_ru.ts by Alexandre Prokoudine) makes it as
  brand first translation delivered. Thanks and welcomes whom
  ever may follow ;)

* Converted obsolete QMessageBox forms to standard buttons.

* Added support for runtime max. voices / disk streams setting
  (accessible from the "Options..." dialog). Those fine tuning
  settings will be saved in case the user modified them and
  automatically restored to the sampler when reconnecting to
  a sampler the next time. 

* Grayed/disabled palette color group fix for dark color themes.

* Fait-divers: desktop menu file touched to openSUSE conventions.

* Due to some trouble with newer Qt >= 4.4 applications regarding
  font size configuration, a new global user option is now available
  to the rescue: View/Options... /Display/Other/Base font size
  (default none).

* Attempt to load Qt's own translation support and get rid of
  the ever warning startup message, unless built in debug mode.
  (transaction by Guido Scholz, while on qsynth-devel, thanks).

* Only one application instance is now allowed to be up and
  running, with immediate but graceful termination upon startup
  iif an already running instance is detected, which will see its
  main widget shown up automatically (Qt/X11 platform only).

* Messages file logging makes its first long overdue appearance,
  with user configurable settings in View/Options.../Server/Logging.

* Bugfix in sampler channel dialog, driver combo boxes' content were
  screwed.

* Automatically add & remove channel strips as they were removed
  e.g. by other frontends.

* Refresh device management dialog when device informations changed,
  e.g. on changes caused by other frontends
  (fixes segfault on device changes)

* Implemented MIDI device activity windows, selectable from the
  "View" main menu.

* Implemented MIDI activity indicator on channel strips.

* Added FX Sends Dialog to Channel Strips.

* Color pallete fix for the instrument name display in channel
  strip, particularly notorious on Mac OS X builds.

* Added dialog when the application exits which lets the user
  decide whether to keep the LinuxSampler running or not.


0.2.1  2007-12-06  Qt4 migration was complete.

* Added recent new support of libgig for retrieving instrument
  names in avery fast way. If libgig provides this feature, then
  the respective name retrieval setting in qsampler is enabled by
  default.

* The current selected/activated channel-strip is now visually
  evident while in the application workspace (highlighting).

* Make View/Menubar and Toolbar shortcuts accessible even though
  the main menu and toobar are not visible.

* Audio routing table is initially hidden in the dialog, when
  creating a new sampler channel.

* README requirements and configuration notes update.

* Disable OK button in sampler channel form and MIDI instrument
  form if no valid engine is selected (to avoid bothering newbie
  users with confusing LSCP syntax errors when using the UI the
  first time).

* Fixed creation of devices (don't try to set device parameters
  which the user did not touch in the device creation dialog).

* Added Windows file path support.

* Fixed win32/qmakefile and win32/config.h so that it compiles
  under win32.

* Qt4 port of the application.


0.1.5  2007-10-15 Five months later a fifth is heard.

* Added support for LSCP escape sequences to allow loading and
  mapping instrument files with special characters in their
  filename, as well as special characters for instrument names
  and instrument map names (requires LSCP v1.2 on sampler side).

* Added new button "Edit" to the channel strips, which probably
  does exactly what you think it does: it opens an appropriate
  instrument editor application; the channel instrument editor
  tool is also accessible from the main menu and toolbar.

* Application icon is now installed to ${prefix}/share/pixmaps;
  application desktop entry file is now included in installation;
  spec file (RPM) is now a bit more openSUSE compliant.

* Crash fix on double-clicking on a empty instrument list.


0.1.4  2007-05-04 Almost another year has gone by.

* Channel button colors have changed: yellow for mute and
  cyan for solo is now the rule, but note that this color
  highlighting is only rendered on some widget styles.

* Master sampler volume slider/spinbox combo is now featured.

* Initial support for sampler channel FX sends, while saving
  the session state, only at code-level.

* Sampler channel setup dialog does not mandate for valid nor
  existing instrument file name.

* Revised error verbosity in general and on session load/save;
  hour-glass wait cursor is now displayed on session load/save;
  keyboard shortcuts changed on MIDI instruments view context;
  improved channel strip arrangement on session open/load;
  instrument map entry removal confirmation (as optional);
  corrected some tooltip text strings.

* Most top-level widgets were missing the normal-widget flag,
  which were causing some sticky size behavior while on some
  window managers.

* Added preliminary MIDI instrument mapping support; now
  with an instrument list widget and editing capabilities;
  MIDI instrumeent map program numbers are now displayed in
  the range 1-128, instead of the internal 0-127.

* GPL address update.


0.1.3   2006-06-01 Its been a long year isn't it?

* Changed deprecated copyright attribute to license,
  on qsampler.spec (RPM).

* Added configure support for x86_64 libraries (UNTESTED).

* Optional specification of alternate liblscp and libgig
  installation paths have been added to configure command
  arguments (--with-liblscp, --with-libgig).

* Whenever the listing of actual instrument names is not an
  option (e.g. due to lack of libgig support), the whole
  number of selectable instrument items is now being graciously
  increased from just the bare 8 (eight) right up through 100
  (one hundred), on the sampler channel setup dialog.

* The selection buttons, on the right of the Instrument, Audio
  and MIDI devices combo-boxes, on the sampler channel dialog,
  are now expected to be a little better looking than it was
  before, at least for those Mac OS X eyes.

* Minor fixing on the initial messages dock-window height.

* Audio output channel routing configuration finally hits
  the sampler channel dialog, at last!

* All widget captions changed to include proper application
  title name prefix.

* Attempt to bring those aging autoconf templates to date;
  sample SPEC file for RPM build is now being included and
  generated at configure time.

* Set to use QApplication::setMainWidget() instead of
  registering the traditional lastWindowClosed() signal
  to quit() slot, just to let the -geometry command line
  argument have some effect on X11.

* Added MUTE/SOLO buttons to individual channel strips.

* Fixed compilation error which occured when Qt was
  compiled with -no-stl.


0.1.2   2005-06-23 Even minor workings needs a rest.

* Fixed output disability when messages limit option is
  turned off (thanks to Wolfgang Woehl for spotting this
  one, while on qjackctl).

* Added CHANNEL_INFO event feedback notification handling;
  minor stream/voice usage auto-refresh cycle optimization.


0.1.1   2005-06-12 The mantra of bugfixes.

* New improved and full-featured application icon, thanks
  to Christian Schoenebeck design.

* Fixed refresh cycle of channel strips that are found
  in an error state, which was preventing correct channel
  info updates.

* Device configuration now accessible on toolbar. Added
  buddy text label to device port/channel combobox on the
  device dialog.

* Include libgig version info on command line request (-v).

* Minor configure and Makefile install fixes, as Debian and
  Mac OS X specialties. Also, install does the right thing
  with target file modes (thanks to Matt Flax and Ebrahim
  Mayat, for pointing these out).


0.1.0   2005-05-23  Device configuration breakthrough.

* Device configuration is now complete.

* [bug #9] Fixed for a LSCP command syntax convention
  consistency, regarding the enumeration of available
  sampler engines, Audio and MIDI drivers.

* [bug #13] Update instrument names list when a new
  instrument file is select on the channel setup dialog.

* Show appropriate message in channel strip while loading
  an instrument.

* Show libgig version in About box (in case libgig is used).


0.0.5   2005-03-04  Fifth alpha-release.

* Fixed device driver type channel information gathering,
  which was severely flawed, dropping all channel session
  configurations to the default audio driver type (which
  is ALSA) unexpectedly.

* Channels are now properly renumbered when saving to a
  session LSCP script, assuming that it should be always
  loaded from scratch (i.e. zero channels).

* Disabled MIDI port setting on channel dialog, and on
  session file save, as its use is still troublesome.

* Added new menu and toolbar option: Reset All Channels.

* Channel setup changes are now properly filtered, as for
  only those settings that are actually changed gets applied;
  change information are now also posted to messages window.

* Drag-and-drop of either session files (LSCP scripts) or
  instrument files (GIG) are now supported. Multiple files
  drop is allowed, but it only makes sense for instrument
  files, each one prompting to create a new sampler channel.

* Drag-and-drop to an existing channel strip is now also
  featured, allowing the in-place change of the channel
  sampler instrument file.

* Actual instrument names are now optionally retrieved
  from the instrument file, even though libgig is available,
  avoiding excessively annoying load times while on the
  channel dialog, when huge instrument files are selected.

* Set to ignore the SIGPIPE ("Broken pipe") signal, where
  available, as the default handler is usually fatal when
  a JACK client is zombified abruptly.

* Messages window limit is now enforced only when the line
  count exceeds in one third the user configured line count
  maximum; if Qt 3.2.0+ is in use, the QTextView widget is
  otherwise set to the optimized Qt::LogText format.


0.0.4   2004-11-19  Fourth alpha-release.

* Instrument index selection now made via combo box widget;
  actual instrument names are now properly retrieved from
  the instrument file, provided if libgig is available.

* Sampler channels strips are just created if, and only if,
  the respective channel setup dialog is actually accepted,
  following common user-interface guidelines.

* Almost complete rewrite of sampler channel strips internal
  control structures.

* Sampler reset command action added to menu and toolbar.

* MIDI channel selection is now a dropdown list, allowing
  the explicit selection for "All" channels input per sampler
  channel (omni mode).

* Channel strip display glass effect has changed background
  color to black (was green), being now an user option.

* Minor configure fixes.


0.0.3   2004-07-06  Third alpha-release.

* Mon-modal intrument file loading and status support.

* Effective MIDI input port setting on channel dialog,
  and on session file save.

* Channel dialog gets sensible engine and driver defaults
  on create time.

* Implied channel reset on successful instrument load.


0.0.2   2004-06-15  Pre-revolutionary release.

* The channel context menu is also accessible by right-clicking
  over the empty workspace area.

* Added small wait event loop on qsamplerMainForm::stopServer(),
  so let local server terminate gracefully and stabilize, and
  avoiding a probable segfault on exit, which was preventing the
  correct salvage of settings and configuration.

* Maximum channel volume percent setting is now a global option,
  provided to override the default (which is 100%).

* Client/server transaction timeout option upper limit has been
  increased from 5000 to 60000 milliseconds.

* A channel context menu is now featured, by right-clicking over
  each sampler channel strip.

* Commented SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_PORT command from
  qsamplerMainForm::saveSessionFile(), it has no effect.

* Insert a n #include <unistd.h> on qsamplerMessages.cpp, between
  a #if !defined(WIN32) clause.

* An initial non zero value (0.8) is now set for volume of every
  new sampler channel strip.

* The order to load/save and setup channel settings is now as
  suggested in the following lines:

    SET CHANNEL AUDIO_OUTPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_TYPE ...
    SET CHANNEL MIDI_INPUT_CHANNEL ...
    LOAD ENGINE ...
    LOAD INSTRUMENT ...
    SET CHANNEL VOLUME ...


0.0.1   2004-06-05  Primordial alpha release.
